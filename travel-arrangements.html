  <h1>How to Travel to Resort de Megan on the Antipodes</h1>
  <p>Our little paradise is only accessible by boat.  Due to Endangered Species Regulations regarding a species of fish near the island, no motor boats larger than 35 feet are allowed near the island.</p>

  <p>For this reason, we recommend booking your travel arrangements prior to your accomodations with us; travel occasionally takes up to 4 months.</p>
